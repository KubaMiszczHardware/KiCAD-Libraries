# KiCAD Libraries and Modules
updated and ordered KiCAD Library of symbols and Modules (footprints)
also added 3dModels

it contains common elements (at least in my bench:]), removed exotic ones

## IMPORTANT
in Kicad define custom path $KUBALIBS - all paths are relative to it, 
and $KUBADATASHEET - for datasheets PDF files,
or manually edit files and do massive replace with your preferences or sth
